This is a modification of the Android fork of libselinux:

    https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libselinux/

based on commit: d4828b3ba449355aa2d1751026e5f1d1129cedcf

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DualBootPatcher's fork of Android's libselinux removes everything unrelated to
the creation and parsing of the binary file_contexts format. Also, instead of
directly linking against PCRE or PCRE2, the tool dynamically loads libpcre and
checks if it is PCRE or PCRE2 at runtime. This allows the tool to work with
whatever version of PCRE that comes preloaded on the firmware.

All files inside this "file-contexts-tool" folder are under the same license
as Android's fork of libselinux linked above. That is, these files are public
domain software (see the LICENSE file for details).
