# The code signing variables must now be provided via this configuration file.
# The old method of passing these variables directly to the cmake command is no
# longer supported as it causes the password to be saved in multiple places
# within the build directory.
#
# The format of this configuration file is very simple. Each line is in the
# form:
#
#     <key>=<value>
#
# Empty lines and comments (lines beginning with "#") are ignored.

# Global passphrase for the keystore
